            <h2>REDUCES RISKS</h2>
           <span> <p>Knowing what’s happened previously and comparing it to what’s happening currently allows you to see trends. If these trends are consistent, you’ll have a map for what is likely to occur in a year, five years, or more.

                If they’re unfavorable, you’ll have the opportunity to avoid making the same mistakes.
                
                Reducing risks doesn’t come from being right. It’s about mastering your business’ inputs … to better control its outputs.</p></span></div>

            <h2>MEET CUSTOMER DEMANDS</h2>
            <p>
            The value of customer data cannot be overstated. Information on purchases and engagement should unlock and directly shape your DTC marketing plan:
            
           <br> Launching campaigns
           <br> Featuring products in email marketing
           <br> Crafting ad creative throughout your funnel</p></div>

            <h2> PRICING STRATEGY</h2>
           <span> <p> Owners and operators often have a codependent relationship with pricing. We treat it as sacred and fixed when it’s actually open and elastic.
            
            For example, you may have a best-selling product that does poorly during the summer. To keep inventory levels healthy, most retailers decease order volume from suppliers. Instead, could lowering the price off set the off-season?
            
            Conversely, that same product may sell out during peak moments. Rather than increasing stock levels, the right answer could be to charge more.</p></span></div>

        <h2>SEASONALITY</h2>
        <p>Two areas where seasonality has the greatest impact are inventory management and supply chain. 

During inventory planning, forecasts are used to determine customer demand for existing SKUs, new products, and even demand by location — “geographical demand” for physical or omni-channel retailers.

Some high-traffic periods are obvious, like Black Friday. Others are hidden within the past, waiting to be revealed and operationalized.
